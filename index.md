### Employee Performance Trend Analysis

#### ðŸš€ Challenge: 
Tracking employee performance trends is crucial for understanding efficiency changes over time. This task was necessary to reduce efforts trying to understand who is improving in the team and who is declining. As the direct supervisor of this team, the information derived from this analysis is crucial to me. Other managers and company executives will find this very helpful as well. 

#### ðŸš€ Solution Overview
Designed an interactive dashboard to track efficiency trends of an 80-person team across multiple quarters.
Built using Google Looker Studio and Google Sheets for real-time data visualization.

#### ðŸš€ Tools Used
Google Sheets â†’ Data transformation & storage
Google Looker Studio â†’ Interactive dashboard creation
SQL-Like Formulas â†’ Data calculations and filtering
Google Data Studio Calculated Fields â†’ Custom performance metrics

#### ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

âœ” Data Transformation
Converted wide-format data (columns per quarter) into a long-format structure using ARRAYFORMULA() in Google Sheets.
Applied "Unpivoting" to restructure employee efficiency scores over time.
âœ” Dynamic Performance Analysis
Created line charts to track individual performance trends over multiple quarters.
Used filters and pagination techniques to dynamically view different sets of employees.
Implemented top 10 performers vs. top 10 decliners using CASE WHEN logic.
âœ” KPI Calculation & Metrics
Score Change (%) = Measured improvement or decline in efficiency over time.
Quarterly Trends = Used Looker Studioâ€™s custom calculated fields to extract and compare scores.
âœ” User Interactivity
Added filters, sliders, and drop-down controls to allow management to explore team performance.
Implemented "Top N" filtering to dynamically display best and worst performers.

#### ðŸš€Impact:
âœ” Enabled management to quickly identify high performers & struggling employees
âœ” Provided real-time insights for decision-making
âœ” Made employee data more accessible & actionable
